# Numerical Monochromatization of Broadband Diffraction Patterns
Contains a number of Python scripts for the numerical monochromatization of broadband diffraction patterns.

If you want to use it for your work/research, that's great!
I have included a jupyter notebook with an example on how to use it.
Details on the math and physics can be found in my PhD thesis (http://www.theses.fr/2019SACLS154) and my paper (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41566-020-0660-7).
Please cite this paper if you present/publish work that has benefitted from my code.
If you need any help, do not hesitate to contact me.

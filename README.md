# Numerical Monochromatization of Broadband Diffraction Patterns
Contains a number of Python scripts for the numerical monochromatization of broadband diffraction patterns.

See the included jupyter notebook for an example on how to use it.
Details on the math and physics can be found in my PhD thesis (http://www.theses.fr/2019SACLS154) and my paper (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41566-020-0660-7).

Please contact me if you are interested in using it so I can help where needed.
